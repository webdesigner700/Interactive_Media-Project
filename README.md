This is an individual projct I have undertaken to create a software tool in the processing software.

This software tool accumulates and records live interaction inputs like mouse clicks and keystrokes as data. The 
keystroke data is used to change the speed of the background video and add particle effecets to the exhaust 
of the vehicle. the speed at which the exxhaust particles get generated can also be changed via the keystroke
data.

The mouseclick data is used to add a pixelated video effect to the project. Based on whether the mouse 
clicks are even or odd the pixelated video shown to the user changes. I have also incorporated some background 
music that plays when the uer starts running the project.
